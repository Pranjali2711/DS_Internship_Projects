# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection 

## 📌 Project Overview
Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be detected using chest X-ray images.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.

This project was developed as part of a **Data Science Internship**.
